The first button is the "load button", which loads 10 different images.<br />
The second button can clear the user rate on the tool bar (i.e. set user filter to 0 star).<br />
The third button is the "clear button", which removes all images from the list.<br />
The last widget is the "filter widget", showing 5-stars, used to filter the image list based on rating.<br />

Each image in the grid has a rating bar.<br />
The user can touch a star to select a rating.<br />
